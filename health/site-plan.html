      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is to have a website with information about healthy and affordable options for users and provide links to businesses where they can purchase specific foods. 
        The website will also provide recipes for those at risk of diseases or other health issues like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, celiac disease, etc. 
        The point is to have a single place users can go to where they can find plenty of healthy and affordable options.

      <h4>What foods are considered healthy?</h4>
      <p>
        ‘Healthy foods are those that provide you with the nutrients you need to sustain your body's well-being and retain energy. 
        Water, carbohydrates, fat, protein, vitamins, and minerals are the key nutrients that make up a healthy, balanced diet.’
      </p>
      <h4>What are macros?</h4>
      <p>
        “macro” is short for macronutrient. What's a macronutrient? They're the three categories of nutrients you eat the most and
         provide you with most of your energy: protein, carbohydrates and fats. So when you're counting your macros, you're counting 
         the grams of proteins, carbs or fat that you're consuming.
      </p>
      <h4>Recommended Amounts? </h4>
      <p>
        In general, most adults should target their diets to comprise of 45-65% Carbohydrates, 10-35% Protein and 20-35% Fat. (If you're
        trying to lose weight, the number should be adjusted to 10-30% Carbohydrates, 40-50% Protein and 30-40% Fat.)
