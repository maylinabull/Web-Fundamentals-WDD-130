            ‘Healthy foods are those that provide you with the nutrients
             you need to sustain your body's well-being and retain energy. 
             Water, carbohydrates, fat, protein, vitamins, and minerals are 
             the key nutrients that make up a healthy, balanced diet.’ (Moreland OB-GYN).

            What are macros?

        <!-- Info from https://www.sclhealth.org/blog/2018/10/what-are-macros-and-why-should-i-be-counting-them/ -->
        <p>
            “macro” is short for macronutrient. What's a macronutrient? 
            They're the three categories of nutrients you eat the most 
            and provide you with most of your energy: protein, carbohydrates 
            and fats. So when you're counting your macros, you're counting the
             grams of proteins, carbs or fat that you're consuming (SCL Health).

            In general, most adults should target their diets to comprise of 
            45-65% Carbohydrates, 10-35% Protein and 20-35% Fat. (If you're trying
             to lose weight, the number should be adjusted to 10-30% Carbohydrates, 
             40-50% Protein and 30-40% Fat.) (Prospect Medical).
