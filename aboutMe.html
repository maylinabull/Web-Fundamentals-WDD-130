<p>Hey, y’all! I’m majoring in software engineering, and this is my 4th semester at BYU-I.
I’m from St. Augustine, Florida. I have three sisters, 
and I’ve moved over 14 times. Right now, my family isn’t living in St. Augustine anymore, 
but it is my favorite place I've lived and is where I’ve lived the longest.</p> 
<p>I got back from serving my mission in Los Angeles last summer – 
I did meet a couple of famous people, including the guy that plays Napolean Dynamite at a Trunk or Treat! Originally, I was
supposed to serve in Japan, but because of COVID I was reassigned. </p>
<p>I enjoy hiking, playing soccer, listening to music, watching anime, playing the piano, and learning new things!</p>
