healthy, middle class-higher class, families (older children)
market to older people who are signing up -- 

What they are looking for: affordability, places to go/vacation and/or equipment, adventure!
quality experience, easy access, discounts, tips, safety (waiver), comfort  

Pain points: wwr website competition?, difficulty navigating website because of 
lack of wwr experience?, price, safety, transportation


beginner? button on website (help user navigate), have place for experienced wwr to give advice/share
experiences with beginners! (blog aspect . . .), safety record, shuttle rides 


commit to demographic! take aim, focus/target, message consistency, understand who you are talking to
adventure, safety, discounts (address many demographics?) -- that is difficult 
encouraging/interesting facts throughout website to pull audience in --
