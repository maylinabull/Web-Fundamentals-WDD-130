<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Maylina Bull</h2>
<h2>May</h2>
<p>Hey, y’all! My name is Maylina Bull, and I’m from St. Augustine, Florida. I have three sisters, 
and I’ve moved over 14 times. Right now, my family isn’t living in St. Augustine anymore, 
but it is my favorite place I've lived and is where I’ve lived the longest. I got back from serving my mission in Los Angeles last summer – 
I did meet a couple of famous people, including the guy that plays Napolean Dynamite at a Trunk or Treat! 
I’m hardworking and always looking for ways to push myself out of my comfort zone. I’m majoring in software engineering,
 and this is my 4th semester at BYU-I. </p>
