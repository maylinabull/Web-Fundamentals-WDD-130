Week 6
CSS Layout
normal flow - each element is displayed one after another based on how
we placed them in the HTML
HOW DO WE TAKE BLOCKS OUT OF NORMAL FLOW?
float
position property (relative, absolute)
Flex-box - if you want items in a row or column
Grid (z-index)

Grid Layout
Grid: a layout system that uses rows and columns
explicit and implicit 
implicit - when browser automatically places grid items in the order 
they were in the spaces available automatically
explicit - deliberate 
you can nest grids inside of other grids

Grid Layout pt.2
grid-column-start
grid-column-end


ACTUALLY WATCH THE VIDEOS LATER FOR EXAMPLES!!!


Week 7
justify-content: aligns the grid container alont the inline axis (default horizontal)
only works when grid is narrower thatn the space available

justify-items: aligns the grid item contents along the inline axis (default horizontal)
only works when the contents of a grid cel are narrower than the grid cell

align-content: aligns the grid container along the block axis (default vertical)
only works when te grid is shorter than the space available

align-items: aligns the grid item contents along the block axis (default vertical)
only works when the contents of a grid cell are shorter than the grid cell

justify aligns horizontal, align vertical
if we want to align the grid container we use content
if we want to align the contents of the grid items within the grid cells, use items
