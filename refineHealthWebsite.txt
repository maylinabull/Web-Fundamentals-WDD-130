FIX YOUR WEBSITE
make more user friendly?  

put text on home images? make sure to make readable (white text box) ...
get rid of flip image lines ... 

grid - restraunt name and then food items, put line in between
(just fix so it isn't basic bullet points -- it looks ... wrong) 

underline animation on recipe page --- just delete if you can't figure it out
