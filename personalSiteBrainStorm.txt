1.) identify your goal
To help inform users on healthy and affordable options/recipies/tips 

2.) explain what you want the website to do
To offer users with helpful information 

3.) communicate your USP (unique selling proposition)
healthy and affordable

4.) engage with a question

5.) put it all together

6.) practice!

Healthy and affordable options are hard to come by. My goal is to have a website that
informs users of options that are both healthy and affordable, and perhaps provide links
to small businesses that they can purchase from.
